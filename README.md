# wordle-cli
Wordle clone written in Nim

I created this game in an hour or two to teach myself the excellent Nim programming language. It is definitely my favorite new programming language. 

It uses a five letter word list which I provided as well. I might do a html version with Jester as well for fun. 

I will upload other learning experiments here as well.
