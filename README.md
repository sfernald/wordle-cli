# wordle-cli
Wordle clone written in Nim

I created this game in an hour or two to teach myself the Nim programming language. It is a wonderful new programming language.

A plus (+) indicates a letter exists in the wordle but not in that location. a asterisk (*) indicates that the letter exists in the wordle at the exact location. A space ( ) indicates that a letter does not exist in the wordle. 

It uses a five letter word list which I provided as well.

I will upload other learning experiments here as well.
